I made this extension to alert me when I had already watched a certain episode of a tv show on fmovies.to, I would've loved to try and inject CSS into the website. However, fmovies.to auto refreshes and enters debug - mode so you cannot inspect it. </br>
when you try to inspect the page, which makes it rather hard to debug. 
I also used this extension to see how typescript worked with express and node, as a mongoose and mongoDB refresher, and to explore how google chrome extensions work.
In the future, I would like to clean up some code and rename some files a bit cleaner.
